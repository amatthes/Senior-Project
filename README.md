# Senior-Project

This my one semester senior thesis project for the applied math major class AMTH 491 titled "Uncovering Bias in Image Classification Models Using Counterfactual Explanations".

# How To Use the Notebook

In order to use the Jupyter Notebook, you must set up FaderNetworks as layed out [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/FaderNetworks). I generated interpolated images for the Male, Young, and Eyeglasses attributes using the default perameters naming them male_interpolations.pth, young_interpolations.pth, and eyeglasses_interpolations.pth respectively.
